## 🎯 Design Patterns Overview

| Pattern Type   | Pattern        | Space Domain Use Case                                      |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Behavioral     | Strategy       | Slicing strategy for space-grade materials                 |
| Behavioral     | Observer       | Monitoring thermal, vibration, and layer integrity         |
| Creational     | Factory        | Generating printable components (antenna, wheel, panel)    |
| Creational     | Singleton      | Global printer configuration manager                       |
| Structural     | Decorator      | Enhancing print jobs with heat resistance, UV coating      |
| Structural     | Adapter        | Integrating legacy CAD formats into STL pipeline           |
